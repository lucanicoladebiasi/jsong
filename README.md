### JSONata On New Ground!

## Why yet another implementation for JSONata?

This project provides an Open Source implementation of the language
[JSONata 2](https://jsonata.org)
created by Andrew Coleman.

Promising to keep the compatibility with the JSONata 2 grammar,
this project extends the grammar aiming to provide an useful language for 
[ETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load)
operations and workflow definition.

This implementation was created purely from the JSONata language specifications
without any debt from any previous implementation, notably the 
[JavaScript JSONata](https://github.com/jsonata-js/jsonata)
project and
[IBM JSONata4Java](https://github.com/IBM/JSONata4Java)
project to allow the most permissive use of the code.

The author of the project strongly believes

> It is through art, and through art only, that we can realise our perfection. (Oscar Wilde)

without being obsessed if the *perfection* quoted is our or not, just happy to be in search of it,
returning to community of developers a drop of what he withdrew in many years of career.
Art is a gift, a gift should be free from the reciprocation, whatever
[Claude_LÃ©vi-Strauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_L%C3%A9vi-Strauss)
wrote about, albeit about different contexts.

This project uses
[ANTLR 4](https://www.antlr.org/)
to define the JSONata grammar and to generate its parser.
The language processor is implemented in the
[Kotlin 1.8](https://kotlinlang.org/)
language.

## How to use.

### Declare the dependency.

The project is published in
[Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.github.lucanicoladebiasi/jsong/1.0).
comopplete of source code and documentation jars.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.lucanicoladebiasi</groupId>
    <artifactId>jsong</artifactId>
    <version>1.1</version>
</dependency>
```

### Code with JSong

#### Kotlin

Kotlin is handy to declare JSON objects.
Suppose  to define an `address` object as explained in the [Simple Queries](https://docs.jsonata.org/simple) page
of the official JSONata documentation: in Kotlin this is defined as follows.

```kotlin
@Language("JSON")
val root: JsonNode = mapper.readTree(
        """
        {
          "FirstName": "Fred",
          "Surname": "Smith",
          "Age": 28,
          "Address": {
            "Street": "Hursley Park",
            "City": "Winchester",
            "Postcode": "SO21 2JN"
          },
          "Phone": [
            {
              "type": "home",
              "number": "0203 544 1234"
            },
            {
              "type": "office",
              "number": "01962 001234"
            },
            {
              "type": "office",
              "number": "01962 001235"
            },
            {
              "type": "mobile",
              "number": "077 7700 1234"
            }
          ],
          "Email": [
            {
              "type": "work",
              "address": ["fred.smith@my-work.com", "fsmith@my-work.com"]
            },
            {
              "type": "home",
              "address": ["freddy@my-social.com", "frederic.smith@very-serious.com"]
            }
          ],
          "Other": {
            "Over 18 ?": true,
            "Misc": null,
            "Alternative.Address": {
              "Street": "Brick Lane",
              "City": "London",
              "Postcode": "E1 6RF"
            }
          }
        }
        """.trimIndent()
    )
```

To evaluate the JSONata expression `Address.City` to the JSON object `addreess`, the code is as simple as

```kotlin
val expression = "Address.City" 
val result = Processor(root).evaluate(expression)
```

where

* `root` is the `JsonNode` object to evaluate with the JSONata `expression`, `root` can be `null`;
* `expression` is a string being a valid JSONata statement;
* `result` returns the outcome of `expression` applied to `root`, 
   it is a `JsonNode` object and it can be `null`. 
   For the above example, `result` is a `TextNode` wrapping "Winchester" string.

JUnit tests are organized per page of the JSONata official documentation,
please, refer to them for a rich set of examples about how to use this software.

The code is documented: start reading the documentation of the `io.github.lucanicoladebiasi.jsong1.Processor` class.

## Changes from previous version

The [order-by](https://docs.jsonata.org/path-operators#---order-by) path operator is full implemented.

## Current limitations.

* Operators
  * The [transform](https://docs.jsonata.org/other-operators#-------transform) operator (planned for 1.2 release).
* Functions
  * [$formatInteger()](https://docs.jsonata.org/numeric-functions#formatinteger) doesn't implement the JS `picture` argument.
  * [$formatNumber()](https://docs.jsonata.org/numeric-functions#formatnumber) doesn't implement the `options` argument.
  * [$fromMillis()](https://docs.jsonata.org/date-time-functions#frommillis) doesn't implement the JS `picture` argument.
  * [$parseInteger()](https://docs.jsonata.org/numeric-functions#formatnumber) doesn't implement the `options` argument.
  * [$replace()](https://docs.jsonata.org/string-functions#replace) doesn't implement the `limit` argument, the `replacement` doesn't parse the regex group reference.
  * [$toMillis()](https://docs.jsonata.org/date-time-functions#tomillis) doesn't implement the JS `picture` argument.
