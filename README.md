### JSONata On New Ground!

## Why yet another implementation for JSONata?

This project provides an Open Source implementation of the language
[JSONata 2](https://jsonata.org)
created by Andrew Coleman.

Promising to keep the compatibility with the JSONata 2 grammar,
this project extends the grammar aiming to provide an useful language for 
[ETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load)
operations and workflow definition.

This implementation was created purely from the JSONata language specifications
without any debt from any previous implementation, notably the 
[JavaScript JSONata](https://github.com/jsonata-js/jsonata)
project and
[IBM JSONata4Java](https://github.com/IBM/JSONata4Java)
project to allow the most permissive use of the code.

The author of the project strongly believes

> It is through art, and through art only, that we can realise our perfection. (Oscar Wilde)

without being obsessed if the *perfection* quoted is our or not, just happy to be in search of it,
returning to community of developers a drop of what he withdrew in many years of career.
Art is a gift, a gift should be free from the reciprocation, whatever
[Claude_LÃ©vi-Strauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_L%C3%A9vi-Strauss)
wrote about, albeit about different contexts.

This project uses
[ANTLR 4](https://www.antlr.org/)
to define the JSONata grammar and to generate its parser.
The language processor is implemented in the
[Kotlin 1.8](https://kotlinlang.org/)
language.
